# SBSPS-Challenge-3524-REBOS-Recruitment-Bot-for-Online-Selection-

Exsisting Problem:

52% of talent acquisition leaders say that the most difficult part of their job
is to shortlist the right candidate and 3% of candidates never hear back
from a company after one touchpoint. On the flip side, it’s a challenge for
employers to communicate well with all their candidates. For high volume
recruiting, this would require communicating with thousands of candidates,
in addition to a recruiter’s normal screening functions and other duties.

Proposed Solution:

An Artificial Intelligence enabled software bot that would oversee the whole
recruitment process, where the bot would communicate with each
individual candidate, take in all required information, provide the candidate
with a technical and personality based question to determine if he or she is
the right cacndidate for the companey. Once decided the candidates
shortlisted are proposed to the companey as the best candidates.
