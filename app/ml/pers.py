samp = R'I don‚Äôt like personality tests! Whether they reveal something right or wrong about you, I don‚Äôt want to reduce people‚Äôs understanding of me to four letters, or five numbers, or a few signs. I could write many pages about how this slapdash way of ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù a person might lead to discrimination at work, misguided judgment, or violations of one‚Äôs privacy, but that‚Äôs not quite the point of this blogpost ‚Äî though it is the motivation behind writing it. Here, I will focus on one specific new form of personality testing ‚Äî one that relies on machine learning. I‚Äôm referring to the IBM Watson product called Personality Insights. According to IBM‚Äôs website, the tool ‚Äúuses linguistic analytics to infer individuals‚Äô intrinsic personality characteristics, including Big Five [or O.C.E.A.N], Needs, and Values, from digital communications such as email, text messages, tweets, and forum posts.‚Äù'

samp2 = R' In addition, Personality Insights shows your consumption habits and ‚Äútemporal behavior‚Äù (if the input text is timestamped). Let me show you what this means. I fed the tool with my Twitter feed and received this nice visualization of the tool‚Äôs output, supposedly showing my personality characteristics, consumer needs, and values:If you look into the output file (here), you can see that, according to the tool, I am more likely to ‚Äúto be influenced by online ads when making product purchases.‚Äù Also, I am more likely to be concerned about the environment and to like documentaries, and am less likely to like musical movies (ü§öüèΩobjection: one of my favorite shows these days is Crazy Ex-Girlfriend)'
